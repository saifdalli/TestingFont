<p class="raqi">Etihad Etisalat (Mobily) is a Saudi company established in 2004. The Company’s major shareholders are Etisalat Emirates Group (27.99%) and the General Organization for Social Insurance (11.85%). The remaining shares are owned by institutional and retail investors.

As the winning bidder for Saudi Arabia’s second GSM license in 2004, Mobily ended a monopoly in the wireless industry to provide mobile telecommunications services nationwide. After a six-month preparatory phase, it launched commercially in May 2005, acquiring over one million subscribers in its first 90 days of operation. In 2006, the GSM Association named Mobily the fastest growing mobile operator in the Middle East and North Africa. The same year, it launched 3.5G services, with 4G services introduced in 2011.

Mobily’s growth has been characterized by a series of significant strategic acquisitions. In 2008, it acquired Bayanat al-Oula, a licensed data service provider, and later that year it acquired an absolute majority stake in Zajil, the leading Saudi internet service provider. The Company owns 66% of the Saudi National Fiber Network (SNFN), one of the world’s largest fiber-optic networks, which enables the Mobily to rely on strong backhauling capacity to offer its customers comprehensive communication, mobile and broadband services.

Mobily provides integrated services for three main sectors, namely individuals, business, and carriers. It has one of the largest wireless networks by coverage in Saudi Arabia, as well as the region, and one of the widest FTTH networks, in addition to one of the largest data center systems worldwide.

The Company’s network comprises its own infrastructure and those of Bayanat al-Oula and SNFN. This is the Kingdom’s newest fiber-optic network, with access to all major cities and more than 33,000 km of roads. The network has been expanded to connect to neighboring countries including Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Jordan.

Mobily has been listed on Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul stock exchange since 2004. It has a share capital of SAR 7,700 million, comprising 770 million shares of SAR 10.00 each, paid in full. As at 31 September 2018 the total equity was SAR 13.8 billion.</p>
